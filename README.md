## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Docker installed locally (optional, for testing)

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Jerryabah/nimbus-devsecops-starter.git
cd nimbus-devsecops-starter

# Configure AWS credentials for GitHub Actions
# Go to GitHub → Settings → Secrets and add:
# - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
# - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
# - AWS_REGION (us-east-1)

# Run initial setup script
./scripts/setup/bootstrap-aws.sh
```

### 2. Deploy Infrastructure
```bash
# Deploy secure networking foundation
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file infrastructure/aws/networking.yml \
  --stack-name nimbus-network \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

# Deploy ECS cluster with security hardening
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file infrastructure/aws/ecs-cluster.yml \
  --stack-name nimbus-ecs \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

### 3. Run Security Pipeline
```bash
# Push code to trigger automated security pipeline
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Nimbus Analytics security implementation"
git push origin main

# Monitor pipeline execution in GitHub Actions
# Review security findings in GitHub Security tab
```

## 🔒 Security Controls Implementation

### Container Security Hardening
- **Non-root execution**: All containers run as unprivileged users
- **Read-only filesystems**: Runtime file modifications prevented
- **Resource limits**: CPU/memory constraints prevent resource exhaustion
- **Minimal attack surface**: Distroless/Alpine base images only
- **Secrets management**: No hardcoded credentials, external secret injection

### Network Security
- **Zero-trust networking**: Default deny, explicit allow policies
- **Network segmentation**: Isolated subnets for different service tiers
- **TLS everywhere**: All inter-service communication encrypted
- **Web Application Firewall**: Protection against common attacks
- **DDoS protection**: CloudFlare/AWS Shield integration

### DevSecOps Pipeline Integration
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Local security checks before code submission
- **Static analysis**: SAST scanning for code vulnerabilities  
- **Container scanning**: Multi-layer vulnerability detection
- **Infrastructure scanning**: IaC security policy validation
- **Compliance checking**: Automated regulatory requirement validation
- **Security testing**: Dynamic security testing in staging environments

### Runtime Security Monitoring
- **Behavioral monitoring**: Anomaly detection for running containers
