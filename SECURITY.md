## Security Overview

Nimbus Analytics implements a comprehensive DevSecOps security posture designed to protect sensitive financial and personal data processed by our analytics platform. Our security strategy follows the **Zero Trust Architecture** principle and implements **Defense in Depth** controls across all layers of our infrastructure.

### Security Principles

1. **Shift-Left Security**: Security is integrated into every stage of development
2. **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify - no implicit trust zones
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
4. **Least Privilege**: Minimal required access for all components
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and response
6. **Compliance by Design**: Built-in regulatory compliance controls

## Threat Model

### Assets Protected
- **Customer Financial Data**: Transaction records, account information, financial analytics
- **Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**: Customer personal data subject to GDPR
- **Intellectual Property**: Analytics algorithms, business logic, proprietary code
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud resources, containers, databases, network components
- **Credentials**: API keys, database passwords, certificates, access tokens

### Threat Actors
- **External Attackers**: Cybercriminals seeking financial data or system access
- **Nation-State Actors**: Advanced persistent threats targeting intellectual property
- **Malicious Insiders**: Employees or contractors with privileged access
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromised third-party dependencies or tools
- **Automated Threats**: Botnets, scanners, and automated attack tools

### Attack Vectors
- **Container Vulnerabilities**: Exploiting unpatched software in container images
- **Network Attacks**: Man-in-the-middle, DDoS, lateral movement
- **Application Attacks**: SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass
- **Infrastructure Attacks**: Cloud misconfigurations, privilege escalation
- **Social Engineering**: Phishing, pretexting targeting employees

## Security Controls

### 1. Container Security

#### Hardening Measures
- **Non-root execution**: All containers run as unprivileged users (UID 1001+)
- **Read-only filesystems**: Runtime file modifications prevented
- **Capability dropping**: Linux capabilities restricted to minimum required
- **Resource limits**: CPU and memory constraints prevent resource exhaustion
- **Distroless images**: Minimal attack surface using Alpine/distroless base images
- **Multi-stage builds**: Build dependencies excluded from runtime images

#### Vulnerability Management
- **Automated scanning**: Trivy scans all container images for CVEs
- **Continuous monitoring**: Daily scans for new vulnerabilities
- **Severity-based triage**: Critical/High vulnerabilities prioritized for patching
- **Base image updates**: Regular updates to base images and dependencies
- **SBOM generation**: Software Bill of Materials for supply chain transparency

### 2. Network Security

#### Network Segmentation
```
Internet → WAF → Load Balancer → Private Subnets → Database Subnets
     ↓         ↓           ↓              ↓              ↓
   Public    Public    Private        Private       Isolated
   Access    Subnet    Subnet         Subnet        Subnet
```

#### Traffic Controls
- **Security Groups**: Stateful firewalls with least-privilege rules
- **NACLs**: Network-level access controls for subnet isolation
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Complete network traffic logging for forensics
- **TLS Everywhere**: All inter-service communication encrypted
- **Private DNS**: Internal service discovery via Route 53 private zones

### 3. Identity and Access Management

#### Authentication
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all human access
- **Service Accounts**: Dedicated IAM roles for application services
- **Short-lived tokens**: Temporary credentials with automatic rotation
- **Certificate-based auth**: mTLS for service-to-service communication

#### Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Permissions based on job functions
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum required permissions granted
- **Resource-level permissions**: Granular access controls on AWS resources
- **Segregation of duties**: Critical operations require multiple approvals

### 4. Data Protection

#### Encryption
- **Encryption at Rest**: All data encrypted using AWS KMS
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Key Management**: Centralized key rotation and access logging
- **Field-level encryption**: Sensitive PII encrypted at application level

#### Data Classification
- **Public**: Marketing materials, public documentation
- **Internal**: Business information, non-sensitive analytics
- **Confidential**: Customer financial data, proprietary algorithms
- **Restricted**: PII, authentication credentials, encryption keys

### 5. Application Security
